2)Condition Checking: Compares user guesses with the target number.
3)Feedback System: Displays messages such as “Correct Guess” or “Try Again”.
4)Game Ending: Ends the game upon correct guess or based on conditions.

**Technologies Used**
1)C++: Core programming logic implementation.
2)Dev-C++: IDE used for compilation and execution.

**Features**
1)Simple and interactive gameplay.
2)Useful for beginners to understand flow control and logic in C++.
3)Can be extended with levels, attempts count, and randomization.

**Output Example**
User enters a number
Program checks correctness
Displays result accordingly
